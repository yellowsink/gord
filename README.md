**WARNING: Third party clients are discouraged and against the Discord TOS. There have already been cordless users that got banned, including Bios-Marcel, the maker and maintainer of cordless, and I assume that the same will be true for Gord**

Gord is a custom [Discord](https://discord.com/app) client that aims to
have a low memory footprint and be aimed at power-users.

The application only uses the official Discord API and doesn't send data to
third parties. However, this application is not an official product by
Discord Inc.

## Installation

### Using prebuilt binaries

If you don't want to build the application yourself or use some kind of
package management system, you can get the latest binaries for the three
major systems in the release overview:

https://github.com/cainy-a/gord/releases/latest

### Building from source

In order to execute the following commands, you need to install **go 1.13 or**
higher. You can find golang packages at https://golang.org/doc/install.
On top of that, you need to have **git** installed. It can be fund at
https://git-scm.com/downloads.

**UPDATES HAVE TO BE INSTALLED MANUALLY**

Open a command line and execute the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cainy-a/gord
cd gord
go build
```

This will create an executable file called `gord` or `gord.exe`
depending on whether you are on Windows or not. Move that file anywhere
 that your terminal can find it. I recommend adding a `bin` folder to your
user home and adding it to your systems `PATH` variable. Please search the
internet, using your favourite search engine, for
`how to set an environment variable in XXX` in order to update your `PATH`
variable correctly.

For updateing you simply have to delete the folder you downloaded last
time and repeat the instructions.

Note:

* X11 users need `xclip` in order to copy and paste.
* Wayland users need `wl-clipboard` in order to copy and paste.
* Mac OS users need `pngpaste` in order to copy and paste images.

### Login

**YOUR PASSWORD IS NEVER SAVED LOCALLY.**

Logging in works via the UI on first startup of the application.

If you are logging in with a bot token, you have to prepend `Bot` in front of
the token.

If you need to find out how to retrieve your token, check [the wiki](https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/cordless/wiki/Retrieving-your-token).

**Currently captcha-code login isn't supported. Thanks for your SHIT-API, Google**
